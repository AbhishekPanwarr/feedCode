As a Codeforces contest evaluator, you are reviewing code solutions from both a tester and a master-level programmer on Codeforces. Below, you are provided with 5 different multi-line code submissions by the tester, followed by the master’s code.

For problem 1
Tester's code:
{tc1}

Master's code:
{mc1}

For problem 2
Tester's code:
{tc2}

Master's code:
{mc2}

For problem 3
Tester's code:
{tc3}

Master's code:
{mc3}

For problem 4
Tester's code:
{tc4}

Master's code:
{mc4}

For problem 5
Tester's code:
{tc5}

Master's code:
{mc5}

You will analyze all the tester’s solutions collectively, comparing them to the master’s solutions for the same problems, and provide a single Python dictionary containing your reasoning, with each reasoning provided **only once** for all the tester’s code with reference to the master's code on the following 7 factors:

1. Coding Style and Structure: Analyze the tester’s coding style (e.g., use of macros, input-output style, etc.).
2. Core Solution Analysis: Summarize the main logic of the tester’s solutions (excluding input, output, and test case handling).
3. Complexity Analysis: Provide the time complexity and space complexity of the tester’s code.
4. Data Structures Used: List the data structures used by the tester and compare their relevance to common alternatives for similar problems.
5. Algorithm Identification: Identify the algorithms used by the tester and compare them to common algorithms used for similar problems.
6. Potential Errors and Edge Cases: Highlight potential errors or weaknesses in the tester’s solutions (e.g., off-by-one errors, edge cases).
7. Code Readability and Formatting: Evaluate the readability and formatting of the tester’s code (e.g., indentation, variable naming).

Output:
You must output a Python dictionary with the following keys:
- "Coding Style and Structure"
- "Core Solution Analysis"
- "Complexity Analysis"
- "Data Structures Used"
- "Algorithm Identification"
- "Potential Errors and Edge Cases
- "Code Readability and Formatting"

Each key should contain your reasoning **specific to the tester’s solutions**. Generate the dictionary **only once**, after analyzing all the provided tester and master codes. **Do not include any additional text or explanations outside the dictionary.**
